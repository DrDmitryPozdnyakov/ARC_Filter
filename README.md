# Adaptive Rank-Cluster Image Filter (ARC-Filter)

In this fork, I added a Fashionpedia benchmark to test how preprocessing affects RF-DETR segmentation. With mixed synthetic noise, ARC scored **30.82 mask AP** versus **27.96** without filtering. On clean images, ARC lowered mask AP by **0.31 points**. [Results and evaluation setup](#downstream-evaluation)

This repository contains the official high-performance implementation of the **Adaptive Rank-Cluster Image Filter (ARC-Filter)**, synchronized across two major scientific computing platforms: **MATLAB** and **Python (NumPy/SciPy)**.

The filter is specifically optimized for advanced Computer Vision tasks, medical imaging (e.g., high bit-depth X-Ray/CT scans), and scientific data analysis.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Bit-Depth Integrity:** Flawless handling of 8-bit and 16-bit grayscale and RGB images (including complex LibTIFF biomedical data layers).
- **Speed Optimization:** Python implementation leverages fast vectorization via native NumPy array operations and memory-efficient matrix layout matching.
- **Color Space Preservation:** Advanced RGB ↔ HSV transformation ensures noise filtering operates strictly on the luminance (Value) channel without altering chrominance metadata.

## Repository Structure
- `Images/` — Directory containing test image datasets (supports `.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tiff`, `.tif`).
- `main.py` — The optimized Python execution pipeline (automated folder scan, image processing, and strict MATLAB-compatible quantization).
- `arc_filter.py` — The core vectorized ARC-filter algorithm.
- `ARC_filtering.m` — Monolithic, high-speed MATLAB program containing both the execution pipeline and the internal ARC-filter algorithm.
- `scripts/` — Fashionpedia evaluation runner comparing no filter, median, bilateral, and ARC for a fixed RF-DETR Seg Small model.
- `requirements.txt` — Clean Python package dependencies list.
- `requirements-fashionpedia.txt` — Extra dependencies for the Fashionpedia evaluation (`scripts/arc_full_valid.py`).
- `LICENSE` — Official MIT License terms.

## Verification & Precision
Rigorous mathematical validation confirms **99.99% pixel-to-pixel structural identity** between the MATLAB and Python runtimes (verified via structural similarity metrics). 

*Note on cross-platform math:* Minor standalone differences ($\pm1$ intensity grade in edge-case contrast regions or color cascade spaces) represent standard platform-specific floating-point arithmetic variances (Intel MKL vs SciPy/Cephes `erf` approximations and compiler-specific register precisions during high-contrast threshold division).

## Downstream Evaluation

We evaluated ARC as a preprocessing step for a fixed RF-DETR Seg Small model on 1,158 Fashionpedia validation images. Under mixed Gaussian noise (σ = 0.10 on a [0, 1] scale) and 1% salt-and-pepper noise, ARC achieved 30.82 mask AP, compared with 29.27 for median filtering, 27.96 without filtering, and 27.87 for bilateral filtering. Results were averaged over three noise seeds at a detection score cutoff of 0.05. On the original images, ARC reduced mask AP by 0.31 points relative to no filtering. In a separate 30-image check with one noise seed, lowering the cutoff from 0.05 to 0.001 narrowed ARC’s lead over median filtering from 1.26 to 0.59 points. Install the evaluation dependencies with `pip install -r requirements-fashionpedia.txt`. The experiment requires the Fashionpedia validation split and the Fashionpedia-finetuned RF-DETR Seg Small checkpoint used here. The weights are not included in this repository. Run `python scripts/arc_full_valid.py --help` for the expected paths and evaluation options.

### Experimental ARC13 pilot

The experimental 13-pixel neighborhood extends the original 3×3 with four axial pixels at distance two. Both variants take the median of all 13 values; trimming two or three values from each end leaves 9 or 7 values for Otsu, respectively. These are experimental alternatives, not established improvements over ARC9.

With the validation data and checkpoint described above, run a 30-image pilot using an external JSON list of image IDs and output directory:

```bash
python scripts/arc13_pilot.py --image-ids /path/to/image_ids.json --out /path/to/pilot
python scripts/arc13_pilot.py --evaluate-only --out /path/to/pilot --replay-out /path/to/replay
```

Replay uses saved predictions and provenance with matching local annotations, without loading the model. Output directories must be outside the repository; replay outputs must be fresh. See `python scripts/arc13_pilot.py --help` for required inputs and details.

## Quick Start (Python)
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
2. Place your source images into the `Images/` subfolder.
3. Install the clean required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the consecutive processing pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
Filtered images will be automatically saved into the same `Images/` directory with the `_out(m)` suffix.

## AI Disclosure
The “Gemini 3.6 Flash” multimodal AI model by Google was utilized during the development phase of the software. Specifically, AI technologies were applied to solve the following tasks:
- Developing a software MATLAB script to generate a synthetic test image.
- Developing executable software scripts implementing the ARC filter algorithm.
- Performing deep optimization of the ARC filter code to reduce image processing time.
